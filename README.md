#PROTE FRAMEWORK.

- This framework is now obsolete. 
- opensourced for historical reason.
- new version is much more simplified and modern .(link to be updated here soon)
- No tests were ever written for this framework but most of the things worked fine and Prote has served several projects(some still running without any problems)
- prote relies heavily on its DIC container. Access to DIC is provided globally, hence every service is available everywhere.

To be updated with new versions and other documentations.
